These are some of the workflows I made and use to help me with tasks.

IN STOCK:
This was workflow ran every 6 hrs to tell me if a product was in stock, I used it to tell me if my candles were in stock to buy more but it can be used for anything.

Create Proxmox VM:
I made this to help me create more VM's on my proxmox machine, instead of going to the web to set it up I can just tell my telegram bot to make one for me, it will give mt the options to choose what OS, how much ram, disk and CPU does it need.

Proxmox Monitoring Report.
This was also used with telegram to tell me the total VMs I have, how many are running and stooped and how much of the Host Resources are being used along with the uptime, it also can do the tempture data but I didn't set it up.

Very simple, all it did was scan a website for the latest tech news, summerize it and also send the link
